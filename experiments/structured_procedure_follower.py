        """
        Extracts a piece of information in a specific format.
        This is done by using the function calling API to create a remember_{field_name} function and executing it.

        This function is useful when you want to extract the outcome of an internal monologue in a specific format. 
        It doesn't work so well for reasoning, so stick to the paradigm of internal monologue -> extract_info.
        The format string is a python format string that determines the format of the stored information.

        Parameters:
        info_format (str):
            The format string that determines the format of the stored information. 
        output_type (Union[BaseModel, Type]):
            The type of the field to be extracted. 
            If a pydantic BaseModel is provided, the field is extracted as a pydantic model.
            If a python Type is provided, the field is extracted as an instance of that type.

        Returns:
        The value of the field remembered by the reasoner

        Examples:
        --------
        Extracting an integer:
        >>> reasoner.add_message('user', "My name's Bill, I'm a 42 y.o. male from New York.")
        >>> reasoner.extract_info("The user is {age} years old.", int)
        25

        Extracting an enum:
        >>> from enum import Enum
        >>> reasoner.add_message("assistant", "I have logically deduced that I am happy.")
        >>> reasoner.extract_info("I am {state}", Enum('MentalState', 'HAPPY SAD'))
        "HAPPY"

        Extracting a pydantic model:
        >>> from pydantic import BaseModel
        >>> class Person(BaseModel):
        ...     name: str
        ...     twitter_handle: str
        ...     is_based: bool = False
        >>> reasoner.add_message("user", "Add Ivan Yevenko (@ivan_yevenko) to the database, he's pretty based.")
        >>> reasoner.extract_info("Added {person} to the database.", Person)
